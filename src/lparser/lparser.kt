** Expression and variable descriptor.
** Code generation for variables and expressions can be delayed to allow
** optimizations; An 'expdesc' structure describes a potentially-delayed
** variable/expression. It has a description of its "main" value plus a
** list of conditional jumps that can also produce its value (generated
** by short-circuit operators 'and'/'or').
